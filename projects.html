        <h3 class="center" id="proj">My Projects</h3>
        <div>
          <p class="text">My journey in the world of web development began in 2023, and I am excited to continue
            down this path of exploration and growth. As I embark on this journey, I am eager to expand
            my skills and knowledge by undertaking various projects that challenge me to think creatively
            and solve complex problems.</p>
          <img class="proj" src="./foto/program1.jpg" alt="programming" />
          <p>In the realm of web development, I am particularly drawn to frameworks like Flask and Django,
            where I aim to build dynamic and scalable web applications. These projects not only provide me
            with hands-on experience but also allow me to explore different facets of web development,
            from front-end design to back-end functionality.</p>
          <p>Moreover, I am equally enthusiastic about venturing into the realm of mobile app development.
            By honing my skills in frameworks such as React Native and Flutter, I aspire to create innovative
            and user-friendly mobile applications that cater to modern-day needs and trends.</p>
          <p>Alongside my endeavors in web and mobile development, I am also delving into the field of software testing.
            I believe that a solid understanding of testing methodologies and practices is essential for delivering
            high-quality software products. Hence, I am actively seeking opportunities to enhance my expertise in areas
            such as test case creation, bug tracking, and quality assurance processes.</p>
          <p>In summary, my journey in web development is fueled by a passion for continuous learning and exploration.
            With each project I undertake, whether it be in Flask, Django, mobile app development, or software testing,
            I am committed to pushing boundaries, honing my skills, and making meaningful contributions to the
            ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

      <div class="content projects" id="project_1">
        <h3  class="center"> Project 1 - Portfolio Website</h3>
        <div>  
          <img class="proj portfolio" src="./foto/portfolio.png" alt="private web" />
          <p>My very first website, a portfolio website, marks the inception of my journey into the realm of web development. It originated from a challenge proposed by Code First Girls, symbolizing the starting
            point of my venture into this dynamic field. This initial project encapsulates the foundational skills
            I acquired during my training and serves as a visual representation of my progress.</p>
          <p>While crafting this website, I strived to imbue it with responsiveness and a plethora of features,
            aspiring to create an immersive digital experience. However, with the passage of time,
            I've come to perceive this website as rudimentary and straightforward. Consequently, I resolved
            to embark on the creation of a new website, one that would better reflect my evolving skills
            and aspirations in web development.</p>
          <p>As I continued to broaden my knowledge and refine my abilities, I realized that my inaugural
            website no longer encapsulated the extent of my capabilities. Therefore, I made the decision to
            embark on the development of a new website, one that would embody my journey of growth and development
            in the field of web development.</p>

      <div class="content projects" id="project_2">
        <h3  class="center"> Project 2 - Finance App</h3>
        <div>
          <img class="proj fin" src="./foto/finance.png" alt="private web" />
          <p>C$50 Finance is a web application designed to facilitate the management of stock portfolios.
            With this tool, users can monitor real-time stock prices and track the value of their portfolios.
            Additionally, users have the ability to buy and sell stocks directly through the application
            by querying for stock prices.</p>
          <p>The application leverages external APIs, such as IEX, to retrieve stock quotes.
            For example, by using a URL like https://api.iex.cloud/v1/data/core/quote/nflx?token=API_KEY,
            users can obtain data for a specific stock, in this case, Netflix (symbol: NFLX).
            The API returns the requested data in JSON format, which the application processes to display
            relevant information to the user.</p>
          <p>Overall, C$50 Finance provides users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their stock portfolios,
            offering real-time data and trading capabilities in a user-friendly interface.</p>

        <h3 class="center"> Project 3 - My Personal Website</h3>
        <div>
          <img class="proj portfolio" src="./foto/myweb.png" alt="private web" />
          <p> My homepage represents the culmination of my efforts as my third      independent project. Through meticulous craftsmanship and a keen eye for detail, I designed and developed every aspect of the site.
          Utilizing advanced CSS techniques and media queries, I ensured that the website seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for users across the board.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, I employed JavaScript to add dynamic functionality to the site, enhancing its interactivity and engagement. From animated elements to interactive features, every aspect of the homepage was carefully crafted to captivate and inform visitors effectively.</p>
          <p>Throughout the development process, I continually sought to push the boundaries of my skills and knowledge, experimenting with new techniques and technologies to create a truly standout online presence. The result is a visually stunning and highly functional homepage that reflects my passion
          for web development and commitment to excellence.</p>
