        <h3 class="center" id="proj">My Projects</h3>
        <div>
          <p class="text">My journey in the world of web development began in 2023, and I am excited to continue down this path of exploration and growth. As I embark on this journey, I am eager to expand my skills and knowledge by undertaking various projects that challenge me to think creatively
            and solve complex problems.</p>
          <img class="hobby" src="./foto/program1.jpg" alt="programming" />
          <p>In the realm of web development, I am particularly drawn to frameworks like Flask and Django, where I aim to build dynamic and scalable web applications. These projects not only provide me with hands-on experience but also allow me to explore different facets of web development,
            from front-end design to back-end functionality.</p>
          <p>Moreover, I am equally enthusiastic about venturing into the realm of mobile app development. By honing my skills in frameworks such as React Native and Flutter, I aspire to create innovative and user-friendly mobile applications that cater to modern-day needs and trends.</p>
          <p>Alongside my endeavors in web and mobile development, I am also delving into the field of software testing.

      <div class="content projects" id="project_1">
        <h3  class="center"> Project - Portfolio Website</h3>
        <div>
          <div class="zoomDiv left">
            <a href="https://github.com/MarthaSojka/Portfolio" target="blank">  
              <img class="proj zoom" src="./foto/portfolio.png" alt="private web" />
            </a>
          </div>
          <p>My very first website, a portfolio website, marks the inception of my journey into the realm of web development. It originated from a challenge proposed by Code First Girls, symbolizing the starting point of my venture into this dynamic field. This initial project encapsulates the foundational skills I acquired during my training and serves as a visual representation of my progress.</p>
          <p>While crafting this website, I strived to imbue it with responsiveness and a plethora of features, aspiring to create an immersive digital experience. However, with the passage of time, I've come to perceive this website as rudimentary and straightforward. Consequently, I resolved to embark on the creation of a new website, one that would better reflect my evolving skills and aspirations in web development.</p>
          <p>As I continued to broaden my knowledge and refine my abilities, I realized that my inaugural website no longer encapsulated the extent of my capabilities. Therefore, I made the decision to embark on the development of a new website, one that would embody my journey of growth and development in the field of web development.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="content projects" id="project_2">
        <h3  class="center"> Project - Coding in C</h3>
        <div>
          <p>During my time in the Harvard CS50 course, I tackled a variety of tasks, including those involving programming challenges. As everybody I started from a simple program that displays the message "Hello, World!" on the screen.</p>
          <div class="zoomDiv right">
            <a href="https://github.com/MarthaSojka/Coding-in-C" target="blank">
              <img class="proj zoom" src="./foto/codingC.png" alt="private web" />
            </a>
          </div>
          <p>Then I write a few programs:
            <ul>
              <li class="dotted">Cash: A program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a specified amount of money, utilizing different coin denominations.</li>
              <li class="dotted">Mario (pyramid): A program that draws a pyramid with dots and hashes based on the height provided by the user.</li>
              <li class="dotted">Caesar: A program that encrypts text using the Caesar cipher, shifting letters by a certain number of places in the alphabet.</li>
              <li class="dotted">Substitution: A program implementing a substitution cipher algorithm, where each letter in the text is replaced with another letter according to a given key.</li>
              <li class="dotted">Readability: A program that calculates the average number of sentences per page and the average number of letters per 100 words in a text to assess its readability.</li>
              <li class="dotted">Speller: A program that checks the spelling of text by comparing it with a loaded dictionary.</li>
              <li class="dotted">DNA: A program that analyzes DNA sequences and determines which DNA sequences match a given pattern, using text analysis algorithms.</li>
              <li class="dotted">Foto converter: programs that involved image manipulation. These programs allowed me to perform various operations on images, such as flipping them, blurring them, converting them to grayscale or sepia tones, and applying other filters and effects. For example, one of the programs I worked on might take an input image and apply a blur effect to create a softened appearance. Another program might convert a color image to grayscale, reducing it to shades of black and white. These exercises helped me understand concepts related to image processing and algorithms for manipulating visual data.</li>
              <li class="dotted">Credit: which focused on credit card validation. In this task, the goal was to create a program capable of verifying whether a given credit card number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm. This involved implementing algorithms to check for the card's validity based on its structure and specific mathematical criteria. It was an engaging exercise that deepened my understanding of algorithms and data validation techniques. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>These tasks allow for the development of programming skills, understanding of algorithms and data structures, and practical application of these skills in the context of computer science problems. You can find my solutions to these tasks on my GitHub profile.</p>

      <div class="content projects" id="project_3">
        <h3  class="center"> Project - Finance App</h3>
        <div>
          <div class="zoomDiv left">
            <a href="https://github.com/MarthaSojka/Finance-application" target="blank">  
              <img class="proj portfolio zoom" src="./foto/finance.png" alt="private web" />
            </a>
          </div>
          <p>C$50 Finance is my first web application designed to facilitate the management of stock portfolios. With this tool, users can monitor real-time stock prices and track the value of their portfolios. Additionally, users have the ability to buy and sell stocks directly through the application by querying for stock prices.</p>
          <p>The application leverages external APIs, such as IEX, to retrieve stock quotes. For example, by using a URL like https://api.iex.cloud/v1/data/core/quote/nflx?token=API_KEY, users can obtain data for a specific stock, in this case, Netflix (symbol: NFLX). The API returns the requested data in JSON format, which the application processes to display relevant information to the user.</p>
          <p>Overall, C$50 Finance provides users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their stock portfolios, offering real-time data and trading capabilities in a user-friendly interface.</p>
